    "# Simple RAG for GitHub issues using Hugging Face Zephyr and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "_Authored by: [Maria Khalusova](https://github.com/MKhalusova)_\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can quickly build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for a project's GitHub issues using [`HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) model, and LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is RAG?**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a popular approach to address the issue of a powerful LLM not being aware of specific content due to said content not being in its training data, or hallucinating even when it has seen it before. Such specific content may be proprietary, sensitive, or, as in this example, recent and updated often.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is static and doesn't change regularly, you may consider fine-tuning a large model. In many cases, however, fine-tuning can be costly, and, when done repeatedly (e.g. to address data drift), leads to \"model shift\". This is when the model's behavior changes in ways that are not desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** does not require model fine-tuning. Instead, RAG works by providing an LLM with additional context that is retrieved from relevant data so that it can generate a better-informed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "![RAG diagram](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/rag-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The external data is converted into embedding vectors with a separate embeddings model, and the vectors are kept in a database. Embeddings models are typically small, so updating the embedding vectors on a regular basis is faster, cheaper, and easier than fine-tuning a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the same time, the fact that fine-tuning is not required gives you the freedom to swap your LLM for a more powerful one when it becomes available, or switch to a smaller distilled version, should you need faster inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate building a RAG using an open-source LLM, embeddings model, and LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the required dependencies:"
